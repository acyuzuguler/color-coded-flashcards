# Color-coded Flashcards for German Nouns

196 ready-to-print flashcards for A1 German Nouns. One side of the card is a German word, its article, and its plural, the other side is its English translation. The cards are color-coded based on the gender of the noun (der: blue, das: green, die: red). The nouns taken from [Einfach gut! Deutsch f√ºr die Integration A1.1](https://www.telc.net/fileadmin/user_upload/Downloads_Verlag/Einfach_gut/Wortschatzlisten/Einfach_gut_A1.1_Wortschatzliste_Deutsch.pdf). Some of the compound nouns are omitted (e.g., Kursbuch is omitted as Kurs and Buch are both included). Create a PR if I missed any important word from the list.
